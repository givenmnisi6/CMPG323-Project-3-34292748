# Standards & Patterns

## Overview
In our day and age, millions of applications have been developed and are frequently utilized. The capacity of a developer to read and understand code is more significant than their ability to produce code. An ASP.NET Core MVC Web Application is handed in that will need to be enhanced and improved. Architectural patterns must be understood as well as pay specific attention to implementing coding principles and design patterns.

## Manual
- Stakeholders will be able to use the API from Azure or they can download the code from my GitHub repository and execute it from Visual Studio.
- When they execute it, it will lead them to their desired browser.
- You will find the Home, Register, Login tabs.
- Whereby they must register before utilizing it. 
- When you register, you must provide your email address and password.

## Phase 1 - GitHub Administration
- While I'm in training, I have created & configured my GitHub repository.

## Phase 2 - Project Setup
- I have forked the existing GitHub repository.
- The development branch has been created.
- Added a connection string to the appsettings.json file

## Phase 3 - Design Pattern Implementation
## Design Patterns
Design patterns can help to accelerate the development process by offering tried-and-true development paradigms. Consider concerns that may not become apparent until later in the implementation process for effective software design. Reusing design patterns aids in the prevention of small faults that can lead to larger difficulties, as well as improving code readability for coders and architects who are familiar with the patterns.
-  Repository classes have been created for Devices, Zones and Categories.
